# ShopAI (Pragati Bandhu) — Shop Management with AI Reorder Suggestions
### Project Scope Document v2.2 | April 2026

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Pragati Bandhu** (formerly ShopAI) is a mobile application built for small Indian retail shops that helps owners manage their entire shop — inventory tracking, billing & invoicing, customer credit (udhar) management, business reports, and AI-powered reorder suggestions — all via a simple Android app and WhatsApp alerts.

The core problem it solves: small shop owners in tier-2 and tier-3 Indian towns lose money every day because they run out of stock unexpectedly, over-order and waste capital, lose track of customer credit (udhar), and lack visibility into their business performance. No affordable, simple tool exists for them today.

> **Tagline:** *"Stock khatam hone se pehle, ShopAI bata dega."*
> (Before stock runs out, ShopAI will tell you.)

---

## 2. Target Users

| Business Type | Fit | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Medical / chemist store | Best | Medicines expire, 100s of SKUs, high stakes |
| Kirana / grocery shop | Best | Daily sales, many products, low tech adoption |
| Stationery / book shop | Best | Seasonal demand spikes |
| Hardware store | Good | Many variants, manual tracking painful |
| Salon / beauty shop | Good | Predictable product usage per service |
| Clothing / textile shop | Good | Size + colour variant tracking |
| Restaurant / dhaba | Niche | Daily ingredient stock, habit harder to build |
| Coaching center | Niche | Books + stationery, smaller scale |

**Primary geographic target:** Tier-2 and tier-3 towns in West Bengal and North India — starting with Kāliyāganj and surrounding district.

---

## 3. The Problem

- Shop owners manually track stock in notebooks or memory
- They run out of fast-moving items and lose sales
- They over-order slow-moving items and tie up cash
- They lose track of customer udhar (credit) and outstanding payments
- They have no visibility into sales trends, profit margins, or top-selling products
- No affordable tool exists — existing solutions cost ₹2,000–10,000/month, far beyond reach
- Shop owners are comfortable with WhatsApp but not with complex software

---

## 4. The Solution

A simple Android app where the shopkeeper:
1. Adds products with pricing, categories, and brands
2. Creates bills for customers with cash/udhar payment modes
3. Tracks customer credit (udhar) balances
4. Gets WhatsApp alerts when stock drops low
5. Views business reports with sales breakdown and top products
6. Gets AI-generated reorder suggestions based on sales history

Everything runs on shared infrastructure — one backend serving multiple shops — keeping costs as low as ₹110–340 per shop per month at scale.

### 5.4 AI Reorder Suggestions (Claude API)
- Triggered once daily via cron job (batched across all shops) or on-demand by owner
- Sends anonymised last 14-day sales patterns to Claude API — no product names or shop identity included
- Claude returns: urgency level, days of stock left, suggested reorder quantity, short reason
- Displayed as an inline insights card on the dashboard with urgency badge
- Dedicated AI Suggestions screen planned (currently teaser card only on dashboard)
- Only triggered when user has given data sharing consent
- Suggestions batched to keep API costs minimal (~₹15–40/month per shop)

### 5.5 Business Reports & Analytics
- Time range selector: Today, This Week, This Month
- Total Sales and Net Profit summary stats
- Detailed breakdown by payment type: Cash Sales, UPI Sales, Pending Udhar, Expenses
- Top Selling Products ranking with quantities and revenue
- Download PDF Report export

### 5.6 Low Stock Alerts — WhatsApp
- Low stock detection runs locally on device — works even without internet
- WhatsApp/SMS alerts sent via cloud only when consent is given and internet is available
- Sent via shared WATI account (cost split across all shops)
- SMS fallback via Fast2SMS for shops without WhatsApp
- Owner sets alert timing: instant or daily morning digest
- Alert settings screen planned (not yet built)

### 5.7 Offline Support & Data Sync

ShopAI is designed to work fully offline and sync when internet is available. This is critical for shop owners in areas with unreliable connectivity.

#### Local storage (on device)
- `expo-sqlite` stores all transactional data: products, sales_log, suggestions_cache, sync_queue
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` stores key-value flags: consent setting, auth token, plan type *(Note: originally planned as `react-native-mmkv` but replaced — MMKV v4.3+ requires a native build and is incompatible with Expo Go)*
- All user actions write to SQLite first — the app is always responsive regardless of connectivity

#### Sync queue mechanism
Every write appends a row to a local `sync_queue` table with fields: table name, row ID, operation (insert/update/delete), payload (JSON), and synced status. When internet is available and consent is given, a background processor flushes all unsynced rows as a batch POST to the backend, then marks them as synced.

#### Sync flow
1. User action → write to SQLite + append to sync_queue
2. NetInfo check: if offline, queue stays; retry automatically when online
3. Privacy gate check: if `consent = false`, queue stays local — no cloud sync, no Claude, no WATI
4. If online + consent = true: flush sync_queue → Express API → Supabase
5. Daily cron job then triggers Claude API for that shop's suggestions

### 5.8 Privacy & Data Consent

ShopAI gives shop owners full control over their data. This is presented clearly during onboarding, not buried in a legal wall.

#### Consent flag
A single boolean (`consent_given`) stored in MMKV controls three behaviours: whether the sync queue flushes to cloud, whether Claude API is called for that shop, and whether WATI alerts are sent (requires WhatsApp number stored server-side).

#### What works without consent (local-only mode)
- Full stock tracking, product, category, and brand management
- Billing and invoicing
- Customer and udhar management
- Business reports (local data only)
- Local low-stock detection (`stock < threshold` computed on device)
- Suggestions cache from last sync (if they previously consented)

#### What requires consent
- Cloud backup and multi-device restore
- AI reorder suggestions (Claude API)
- WhatsApp and SMS alerts

#### Onboarding consent screen
Presented during shop setup as two clear radio-card options:
- **"AI suggestions chahiye"** — Smart reordering & analytics (Recommended)
- **"Sirf mere phone pe"** — Basic stock tracking only, no internet data share

Privacy info box: *"Your privacy is important. We never share your shop's location or name with third parties."*

Users who decline can still use the Basic plan (₹299/month) for local-only tracking. The consent screen maps naturally to the plan selection step.

#### Data sent to Claude API (anonymised)
When consent is given, only statistical patterns are sent — never product names, shop names, or location:

```js
{ avg_daily_sales: 10.2, current_stock: 8, min_threshold: 10, trend: "declining", days_left: 0 }
```

| Supplier contact integration | v2 | One-tap WhatsApp to supplier from suggestion |
| Unit variants | v2 | Loose vs packet, sizes, colours |
| UPI payment tracking | v2 | Payment mode split in reports (UI exists, needs backend) |
| Offline mode (full) | v2 | Already partially built in v1 via sync queue |
| Salon — usage per service | v3 | Track product consumed per customer |
| Restaurant — daily ingredient reset | v3 | Perishable stock management |
| Hindi / Bengali language UI (full i18n) | v3 | Bengali tagline already present; full localisation pending |

---

## 16. Go-To-Market Strategy

**Phase 1 — Local vertical focus**
Target one business type in Kāliyāganj first (recommended: medical stores or kirana shops). One happy client refers others — they all know each other and face identical problems.

**Phase 2 — Word of mouth + YouTube**
Document the build and first client onboarding as a YouTube video in Hinglish. Positions the developer as the local AI tech expert. Inbound leads follow.

**Phase 3 — Expand verticals**
Add small customisations per vertical (expiry dates for medical, variants for clothing) and charge slightly higher setup fees while reusing 90% of the codebase.

---

## 17. Competitive Advantage

- Only solution built specifically for small-town Indian shops at Bharat pricing
- Full shop management — inventory, billing, customer credit — in one app
- WhatsApp-native alerts — no new app habit required for shop owners
- Works fully offline — reliable even in areas with poor internet connectivity
- AI suggestions in simple Hindi/English — not technical jargon
- Privacy-first: Basic plan users never share any data, building trust before upsell
- Developer is local — can do on-site setup and support, building trust

---

## 18. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Shops don't enter sales daily | Billing flow makes it natural — every sale = one bill; send daily WhatsApp reminder |
| Claude API costs spike | Batch suggestions once/day; gate behind consent; Basic plan users never hit Claude |
| WATI cost too high early | Start with SMS (Fast2SMS) for first 5 shops |
| Shop owner loses phone | Cloud sync (for consent users) — data restore instantly; local-only users accept the risk |
| Shop owner refuses data sharing | Basic plan still generates ₹299/month revenue with zero Claude cost — better margin |
| Competition from bigger apps | Price, offline support, full billing+CRM, and local presence are the moat |
| Connectivity issues in small towns | Full offline-first architecture with automatic sync when online |

---

---

## 19. Changelog

### v2.2 — April 2026
- **All Phase 1 SQLite wiring complete** (tasks 1–10 in §14.1): all screens read/write live data from local SQLite, no mock data remains
- **`react-native-mmkv` replaced with `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`** — MMKV v4.3+ requires a native build and crashes in Expo Go; AsyncStorage is fully compatible
- **`expo-dev-client` removed** — was causing an unresolvable Intent error on `expo start --android`; not needed for Expo Go workflow
- **Critical bug fixed**: `initDatabase()` was exported from `src/db/sqlite.ts` but never called; all table-creation DDL was silently skipped on every launch. Fixed by adding `useEffect(() => { initDatabase(); }, [])` in `App.tsx`
- **New screens added beyond original scope**:
  - `BillsScreen` — all transactions list with search + payment-mode filter
  - `BillDetailScreen` — receipt-style itemised bill view
  - Both registered in `RootNavigator.tsx`
- **ReportsScreen enhanced**: new "Recent Transactions" section (last 10 bills, each tappable) and "View All Transactions" navigation button
- **`src/db/db.ts` additions**: `getAllBills()`, `getBillItems(billId)`, `getRecentBills(n)`, `getTodaySales()`, `getSalesByRange()`, `getTopProducts()`
- **Tech stack table updated**: MMKV → AsyncStorage entry corrected in §8
